Smart Roads - Predictive Traffic & Logistics App
🚦 Project Overview

Smart Roads is a mobile-first Progressive Web Application (PWA) built with Flutter that helps users avoid traffic congestion, optimize travel planning, and track deliveries in real-time. The platform combines predictive traffic analytics, group travel planning, and live map tracking for commuters, cab drivers, delivery agents, and emergency services.

It can be installed on any mobile device via “Add to Home Screen”:

Android: Chrome “Add to Home Screen” → full-screen app mode

iOS: Safari “Add to Home Screen” → full-screen app mode

The app behaves like a native mobile app with offline fallback support.
